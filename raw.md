1. Crystallography: Understanding Crystal Structures
Crystallography is the study of atomic arrangements in solids. It helps in understanding the structure, properties, and behavior of materials.

Concept of Unit Cell and Space Lattice
Space Lattice: A three-dimensional arrangement of points showing the periodic structure of a crystal.
Unit Cell: The smallest repeating unit that defines the entire crystal structure.
Bravais Lattices
Bravais lattices describe all possible unit cell arrangements in three-dimensional space. There are 14 types of Bravais lattices, classified into 7 crystal systems:

Cubic (SC, BCC, FCC)
Tetragonal
Orthorhombic
Hexagonal
Rhombohedral
Monoclinic
Triclinic
Common Crystal Structures
Simple Cubic (SC) – Atoms at corners only.
Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) – Atoms at corners + one in the center (e.g., Fe, Cr).
Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) – Atoms at corners + one at each face (e.g., Al, Cu, Au).
Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) – Hexagonal unit cell (e.g., Zn, Mg).
Atomic Packing Factor (APF) and Density
APF = (Volume of atoms in unit cell) / (Total volume of unit cell)
APF values: SC = 0.52, BCC = 0.68, FCC = 0.74 (most efficient packing)

Real solids are never perfect; they contain defects that affect mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.

Types of Imperfections
Point Defects (Atomic Scale)

Vacancy – Missing atom.
Interstitial – Extra atom in a non-regular position.
Substitutional – Foreign atom replaces a host atom.
Line Defects (Dislocations)
